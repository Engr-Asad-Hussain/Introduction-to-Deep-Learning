## Introduction-to-Deep-Learning

This Repository consists of following programs:
1.  Area of a Triangle
2.  Area of a Trinagle(s)
3.  Area of a Triangle(s) using the Placeholder
4.  Prediction of a House Price Using tf.estimator

- ### **Area of a Trinagle**
This program is the best example by which you may compute the area of a triangle just by giving the sides of the triangle using the tensorflow. For the learning purpose these kinds of projects are very essential for testing their skills.

- ### **Area of a Trinagle(s)**
The slightly difference between the above is that in this program you may calculate the multiple area(s) of triangle(s) just by inputting the number of sides of a triangle.

- ### **Area of a Triangle(s) Using Placeholder**
Using the placeholder while determining the area use very useful. This makes your model Dynamic nature that is this can be use as a input parameter.

- ### **Prediction of a House Price Using tf.estimator**
Tensorflow is very useful in making prediction. This program will first trained using the local input variables (sq_footage and type) then it will predict any house price but you have to only provide the house's square area and the type of the house that is, is that a house or the appartment.
First segment of the code is first trained and then then second segment is used to predict price.
